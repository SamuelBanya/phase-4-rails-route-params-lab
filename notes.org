* Notes
<2022-10-20 Thu 16:13>: These are the commands I used:
#+begin_src bash
bundle install
rails db:migrate db:seed
#+end_src

I then modified the 'config/routes.rb' routes file with the following contents:
#+begin_src ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get '/students', to: 'students#index'
  get '/students/grades', to: 'students#grades'
  get '/students/highest-grade', to: 'students#highest_grade'
  get "/students/:id", to: "students#show"
end
#+end_src

I then modified the contents of the 'app/controllers/students_controller.rb' controller file with the following contents:
#+begin_src ruby
class StudentsController < ApplicationController

  def index
    students = Student.all
    render json: students
  end

  def show
    student = Student.find(params[:id])
    render json: student
  end

end
#+end_src
